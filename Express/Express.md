## API VS SSR
### API (Application Programming Interface)
API typically refers to RESTful or GraphQL endpoints that allow the client to communicate with the server to fetch, create, update, or delete data. The data is in JSON format!

The server sends data in JSON, we use `res.json()`

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
SSR involves rendering the entire HTML for a webpage on the server side before sending it to the client

The server sends template, we use `res.render()`

## Middleware

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the next middleware function.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks: (1) Execute any code. (2) Make changes to the request and the response objects. (3) End the request-response cycle. (4) Call the next middleware in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it MUST call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging!

There are different kinds of middleware: (1) Our own middleware (2) Built-in middleware (3) Third-party middleware
